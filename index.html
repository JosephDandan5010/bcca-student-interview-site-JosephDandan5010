        <h2> HTML/CSS Interview Website</h2>
            <p>Hi my name is Joseph and this website is an interview with my desk partner on the following questions
            about Base camp. Before we get into the questions let me tell you a little something about Base Camp. Base Camp is an 11 month academy to teach to become full-stack developers by the end of the year.
            Our task at the moment is to interview our desk partners about how base camp is treating them so far.</p>
            <p>The following questions down below have been answered during the interview by my desk partner 
            Kenia between 8:30-9:00 AM.</p>
            <br/>

        <h3> Questions I asked Kenia during our interview.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What has been the toughest week at BCCA? </li>
            <li>What has been the easiest week at BCCA? </li>
            <li>What is your biggest victory so far at BCCA? </li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Kenia's responses to my questions.</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>Her toughest week was her first week at base camp the reasoning is because she was trying to
              grasp the context of Python.</li>
            <li>Her easiest week at base camp so far has been this week.</li>
            <li>Her biggest victory at base camp has been to be able to learn new languages and actually
              make programs in them.</li>  
        </ul>
